# Pokedex CLI

A simple command-line Pokedex written in Go.  
This project exists to learn Go fundamentals by building something concrete and mildly nerdy.

## Goals

- Learn Go project structure
- Practice working with packages and modules
- Make HTTP requests to a public API
- Parse JSON responses
- Build a small but usable CLI tool

## What It Does

- Fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI
- Displays basic information (name, ID, types, stats)
- Runs entirely in the terminal

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or newer
- Internet connection (uses PokéAPI)

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```
